# VTDR Project

## Mission
Build a maintainable, store-centric theme development runtime where documentation acts as an executable roadmap for future contributors.

## Quick Start
```powershell
npm run dev
```

## Documentation Strategy
Effective documentation must:
- explain intent before implementation
- define clear ownership
- provide verification checklists
- stay synchronized with code changes

## Primary Map
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: system layers and boundaries
- `Docs/DEV.md`: contributor workflow
- `Docs/Specifications/`: normative requirements
- `Docs/Integration/`: external contracts
- `Docs/Vision/`: product intent and success metrics

## Operating Rules
1. Update docs in the same change as code.
2. Prefer short, testable requirements.
3. Keep one source of truth per concern.

## Status
- Last full rewrite: 2026-02-17
- Documentation baseline: roadmap-first
